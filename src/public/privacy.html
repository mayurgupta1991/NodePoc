                                            We receive and store any information you enter while using our Services, either through our Website (Welcome.Systems) or mobile applications, or give us in any other way. For example, we collect this information when you create an account, begin a subscription, contact our customer support, register for our message boards, sign up for our email newsletters, or participate in surveys, questionnaires, promotions and give-aways. Examples of the types of personally identifying information that we collect for these purposes may include your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address or other information that could be used to identify or contact you. If you are the host of a property, we also collect the address of that property from you.

                                            We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses this Website or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Welcome Systems on other websites. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; as well as traffic and usage on our Site. We are also able to view the browsing and viewing preferences for each unique welcome channel, as well as which property that content is being viewed from. We may also collect technical information to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.

                                            When you download or use apps created by or on behalf of Welcome Systems, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. If you have questions about how to do this, we recommend that you contact your device manufacturer.

                                            To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Welcome Systems if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please use the unsubscribe method that will be provided in each email we send you.
